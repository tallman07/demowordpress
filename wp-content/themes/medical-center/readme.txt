As soon as you install the theme the metabox "Slider Settings" will appear in the post edit section of Wordpress admin panel.
You will see two input fields in this metabox: text-field and еру checkbox. If you mark the checkbox of featured image of this particular post, it will appear in the slider.
Every post (or page) has its own metabox, so if you go to another post (or page) and mark the checkbox there, the featured image of that post (or page) will be added to the slider as well, and the slider will have two slides. You can have as many posts (or pages) as you want.
The slider itself is located on the front page and consists of three parts: the name (title of post), and an image (featured image of post).
